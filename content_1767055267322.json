      "script": "Most people don’t stay broke because they earn too little.\nThey stay broke because they never learn how money actually works.\n\nIf your income goes up, but your expenses rise even faster, you’re running on a treadmill — not building wealth.\n\nThe rich don’t just work for money.\nThey make money work for them.\n\nThey prioritize assets over liabilities.\nThey invest before they spend.\nAnd they think long-term while everyone else thinks monthly.\n\nSaving alone won’t make you wealthy.\nBut learning how to invest, manage risk, and control lifestyle inflation will.\n\nYou don’t need a million dollars to start.\nYou need the right habits, the right mindset, and consistency.\n\nThe sooner you understand this, the faster your financial life changes.\n\nFollow for more simple money lessons that actually work.",
